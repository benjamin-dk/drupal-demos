INTRODUCTION
------------
A collection of Ajax enabled Drupal forms - meant for demoing and debugging.

REQUIREMENTS
------------
None.

INSTALLATION
------------
 * Install as usual:
 See https://www.drupal.org/documentation/install/modules-themes/modules-8
 for further information.

BACKGROUND
-------------
* Currently only one form is available on /ajax-modal-example. The purpose of
this is to explore the best practice for displaying a form where the contents
of the form (ie. checkbox options) is dynamic because it is defined by data
from an external API.
